  <h1 class="slide-title">How do AWS Canaries work?</h1>
  <p class="slide-description">AWS Canaries work by deploying synthetic transactions or scripts that mimic user interactions with our applications.</p>
  <p class="slide-description">These scripts can perform actions like signing in, navigating through pages, submitting forms, and validating responses.</p>
  <p class="slide-description">Canaries can be set up to run at specified intervals, allowing us to proactively detect issues and address them before our users are affected.</p>
